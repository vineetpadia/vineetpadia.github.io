      <h1>Additive Manufacturing of a Microfluidic Diode</h1>
      <aside>A collection of work over the course of my career and education.</aside>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

     Here we examine the design process and performance of six valve designs printed with multi-jet modeling technology. The ultimate goal of the design challenge is to create a microfluidic diode that experimentally shows the largest Diodicity - the ratio of ’allowed’ to ’obstructed’ fluid flow.

     Here, we investigated the design, manufacturing, and testing
of microfluidic diodes to increase diodicity - the ratio of ’allowed’

to ’obstructed’ fluid flow through the diode. The multi-jet model-
ing (MJM) printer used in this experiment, the Stratasys Objet500

Connex3, allowed the simultaneous printing of both flexible Tan-
goBlack FLX973 and rigid VeroClear RGD810 materials. Its

        The Hyperloop is a new form of transportation which involves a levitating pod moving through a low pressure tube to allow for convenient, efficient, and safe transonic travel.

        As one of the top five teams at Competition, UMD Loop is a team of 50 students at the University of Maryland building a functional half-scale prototype Hyperloop pod as part of SpaceX’s Hyperloop Pod Competition.

      <li>
        Our pod operates using entirely passive magnetic levitation, braking, and control in order to achieve speed in excess of 200 mph!
      </li>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Develop a levitation system that can support the weight of the pod, allow high speed travel and minimize the response to vibration.
    </p>

    <h3>System Description</h3>

    <p>Passive magnetic levitation reduces friction with the track and avoiding common issues with wheels at high speeds. While magnetic drag has a large peak at low velocities prior to levitation, its lift to drag ratio only improves with speed.</p>

    <p>Our levitation system consists of 4 magnet arrays in an aluminum, which will sit nominally at 0.2 in from the ground. These are positioned at the bottom of the array and have wheels rigidly attached to them so that the array will not contact the
      ground. Using the</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The levitation array was designed to be able to levitate the pod after being pushed up to 5-6m/s.
      </li>

      <li>
        The suspension was designed hold the weight of the frame, and to absorb any the loads during an acceleration or brake of 1g.
      </li>

      <li>
        Each levitation array required a minimum harmonic frequency of 120 Hz, to safely avoid the frequency of gaps in the track at speed and to allow for safer handling.
      </li>

      <h2>Testing</h2>

      <p>vThe diodes were designed with two, standardized female ports at their input and output. A small, clear tube running from a reservoir of water in the Fluigent apparatus was inserted into the input port. Another length of clear tube was connected from the output port to a small beaker to collect the outlet fluid. The Fluigent apparatus drives the fluid with pressure, and incrementally records the flow rate through the diode. The resistance of the tubing and the fluidic diodes were calculated at each respective pressure.
