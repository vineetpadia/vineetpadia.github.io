    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Hyperloop is a new form of transportation which involves a levitating pod moving through a low pressure tube to allow for convenient, efficient, and safe transonic travel.
      </li>

      <li>
        As one of the top five teams at Competition, UMD Loop is a team of 50 students at the University of Maryland building a functional half-scale prototype Hyperloop pod as part of SpaceXâ€™s Hyperloop Pod Competition.
      </li>

      <li>
        Our pod operates using entirely passive magnetic levitation, braking, and control in order to achieve speed in excess of 200 mph!
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Develop a levitation system that can support the weight of the pod, allow high speed travel and minimize the response to vibration.
    </p>

    <h3>System Description</h3>

    <p>Passive magnetic levitation reduces friction with the track and avoiding common issues with wheels at high speeds. While magnetic drag has a large peak at low velocities prior to levitation, its lift to drag ratio only improves with speed.</p>

    <p>Our levitation system consists of 4 magnet arrays in an aluminum, which will sit nominally at 0.2 in from the ground. These are positioned at the bottom of the array and have wheels rigidly attached to them so that the array will not contact the
      ground. Using the</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The levitation array was designed to be able to levitate the pod after being pushed up to 5-6m/s.
      </li>

      <li>
        The suspension was designed hold the weight of the frame, and to absorb any the loads during an acceleration or brake of 1g.
      </li>

      <li>
        Each levitation array required a minimum harmonic frequency of 120 Hz, to safely avoid the frequency of gaps in the track at speed and to allow for safer handling.
      </li>

      <h3>Weight Reduction</h3>

      <p>To solve this problem, the team and I decided to focus on parts that were shared between all levitation arrays

      <p>Learned topology optimization in Optistruct to generate lightening patterns in the wheel plates and frame mount. Verified structural stability with NX Nastran FEA</p>
