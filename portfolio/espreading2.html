      <h1>Spreading of Electrolyte Drops on Charged Surfaces</h1>
      <aside>We propose a theory for drop spreading on charged surfaces, showing how that the free-energy change for a spreading drop at various time instants on a charged surface is lesser than that of an uncharged surface. This quantifies the fact that the drop spreads much faster on a charged surface than a normal uncharged surface.</aside>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p> Drop spreading is a widely observable phenomenon around us. It has huge applications in the fields of coating, painting and gluing of surfaces. It can also be used for recovery of crude oil from porous rock beds, lubrication purposes of engineering machinery etc. The liquid is in the form of an oil as for the later cases of lubrication. In this problem we consider a water droplet spreading on a charged rigid substrate. The surface considered has some initial charges. </p>

    <h2>Theory</h2>

    R is the base radius, V is the volume

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The liquid drop always forms a spherical cap      </li>

      <li>
        Neglect the pre-cursor film that invariably precedes the contact line during the spreading.
      </li>

      <li>
        Our pod operates using entirely passive magnetic levitation, braking, and control in order to achieve speed in excess of 200 mph!
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p>


    A drop spreads on a surface due to the action of three components. One is the friction of the substrate that resists the motion of the contact line. The other is the quasi-static Couette flow in the drop that enhances the spreading.
There is a also a contribution from the formation of a precursor film which we have neglected here.
The energy of the electric double layer formed on the substrate enhances the flow of the drop which increases it‚Äôs spreading power.
 We do not consider the presence of EDL at the wedges of the drop that is at the zone of the three phase contact line (TPCL).
The surface has some pre-acquired charges on it.
The evolution of the contact radius with respect to time is much faster for a charged surface.
 We do a parametric study for drop spreading on surfaces with different zeta potential.
The contact angle decreases much faster than the uncharged substrate.
ùëä_ùê∏ùê∑ùêø being a function of the zeta potential decreases as the zeta potential decrases.
In future we plan to calculate the zeta potential for various real life substrates and calculate the EDL potentials of them. We will use that for the drop spreading calculations.
