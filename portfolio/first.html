    <h2>Multi-motor Two Speed Gearbox</h2>

    <p>
      This gearbox was developed during the Ultimate Ascent compention, though it was never fabricated for the competioton, This shifting gearbox uses a dog shifter which engages two different gears on the shifting shaft. The configuraion was designs to accept two CIM motors and one FisherPrice motor from Andymark's Supershifter gearbox. With a few custom gears and mounting plate, we hoped to have the fastest bot at the competition.

    <h3>Lasercut ALuminum Sheet Metal Chassis</h3>

    <p>This design provided a rigid light-weight base for our robot, The design consists of laser cut 1/8" 6061 Aluminum sheet metal. Thankfully, a local elevatorcompany, Cabcraft allowed us to use their industrial laser curtter and bending brake to fabricate our components. The lightening holes used in the model was based on Isogrid, a technique used to reduce weight in aerospace compeionts. This grid pattern consists of triagular cutouts with inegral stiffening ribs. In hindesight, this design was immature because the triangularholes drastically increased the manufacturing time . Instead<, I would reduce the thickness of the sheetmetal to 1/16 to reduce weight. I would also place the truss elements in a orientation that makes the most sensse in terms of forces. One feature that I found extremely helpful was the 1" square slots in the corners of the frams. These holes allowes us to slot in an aluminum square tube frame. We could then easily remove it to simultaneously alter components.

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The levitation array was designed to be able to levitate the pod after being pushed up to 5-6m/s.
      </li>

      <li>
        The suspension was designed hold the weight of the frame, and to absorb any the loads during an acceleration or brake of 1g.
      </li>

      <li>
        Each levitation array required a minimum harmonic frequency of 120 Hz, to safely avoid the frequency of gaps in the track at speed and to allow for safer handling.
      </li>

      <h3>Weight Reduction</h3>

      <p>To solve this problem, the team and I decided to focus on parts that were shared between all levitation arrays

      <p>Learned topology optimization in Optistruct to generate lightening patterns in the wheel plates and frame mount. Verified structural stability with NX Nastran FEA</p>
