            <h1>About</h1>
            <aside>An engineer based in Boston.</aside>
        </header>

        <p>I graduated from the University of Maryland with a major in Mechanical Engineering (2017). I also participated in undergraduate research with Dr. Siddartha Das in the SMIELS lab. I was also active members ASME, Terrapin Hackers, UMD Hyperloop groups on campus.</p>

        <p>I have been working for Festo as a product development engineer, focusing in microfluidics and laboratory automation. Over the last two years, I helped create a new team and facility for rapid development cycles at the company. I spent most of my time designing and developing lab automation components and fluid dispensing systems. My interests range from microfluidics, soft robotics, MEMS, and precision mechanical design.</p>


        <p>In my free time I enjoy exploring the city, visiting muesums, taking various MOOCs via various online platforms, and hacking together control systems with Arduino/Raspi and 3D printers. </p>
