            <h1>About</h1>
        </header>

        <p>I graduated from the University of Maryland with a major in Mechanical Engineering (2017). I participated in undergraduate research with Dr. Siddartha Das in the SMIELS lab. I was also an active member of various groups on campus such as ASME, Terrapin Hackers, and UMD Hyperloop.</p>

        <p>Over the last two years, I have been working for Festo as a product development engineer, focusing in microfluidics and laboratory automation. I helped create a new team and facility for rapid development cycles at the company. I spend most of my time designing and developing lab automation components and fluid dispensing systems. My interests range from microfluidics, soft robotics, MEMS, and precision mechanical design.</p>

        <p>In my free time I enjoy exploring the city, visiting muesums, taking various MOOCs via various online platforms, and hacking together control systems with Arduino and my 3D printer.</p>
